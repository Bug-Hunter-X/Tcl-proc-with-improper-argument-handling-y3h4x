This repository contains a simple Tcl script demonstrating a common error: improper argument handling within a procedure.  The script defines a procedure that attempts to perform arithmetic operations on its arguments but fails when non-numeric values are provided. The solution shows how to handle such situations gracefully, either through explicit type checking or using error handling.
